# ANTIGRAVITY STARTUP RULES

## 1. Platform Independence
We never build dependency on a single private company.
Product must survive without:
- Yemeksepeti
- Google Maps
- Any single data provider

## 2. Problem First
Every feature must answer:
What measurable user pain does this solve?

If no metric, no feature.

## 3. Data Is The Asset
We are not building a UI.
We are building:
- Location intelligence dataset
- Behavioral ranking engine

Data moat > UI polish.

## 4. Narrow Launch
We launch:
- One city
- One niche
- One core promise

Expansion only after retention.

## 5. Retention Over Acquisition
No paid growth before:
30% 7-day retention achieved.

## 6. AI Discipline
AI allowed only for:
- Intent parsing
- Explanation generation
- Insight extraction

AI forbidden for:
- Deterministic ranking
- Distance logic
- Core filtering

## 7. Cost Ceiling
Infrastructure must stay under:
$20/month
Until:
1000 weekly active users.

## 8. Log Everything
Must log:
- Search query
- Click
- Selected result
- Timestamp
- Location cluster

No logging = no future intelligence.

## 9. Build For API Future
All services must be modular:
- GeoEngine
- RankingEngine
- NLPParser
- ExplanationEngine

Each callable as API.

## 10. Kill Fast
If after 6 months:
- No organic growth
- No retention
- No engagement signal

Pivot, don’t patch.
